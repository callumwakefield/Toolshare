        <strong>Welcome to Toolshare</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Tool Share is a platform created to help people throughout 
        New Zealand by allowing users to<br> upload information 
        about their tools allowing others to contact them to borrow 
        them<br> if needed. It also allows you to find tools that 
        you need that are owned by other participants<br> allowing 
        you to borrow them. This process is created to help users 
        to save money by<br> preventing them from having to buy 
        tools that may only be used once or twice and also<br> 
        prevents the wastage that goes along with it.<br>
